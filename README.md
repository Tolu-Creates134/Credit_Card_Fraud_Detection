# Background

Credit card fraud is a major issue in today's society, costing billions of dollars annually. Fraudulent transactions can be difficult to detect, as they often involve small amounts of money and can be disguised as legitimate purchases. Machine learning offers a solution to this problem, by enabling algorithms to learn from patterns in data and identify suspicious transactions in real-time. In this project, we will explore the use of machine learning for credit card fraud detection, using a dataset of credit card transactions to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and help reduce financial losses for both individuals and businesses.


# Obtaining the data and data cleaning 

### Where did the data come from ?

The data was collected from Kaggle and contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
